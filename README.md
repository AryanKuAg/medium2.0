# Notes

Incremental static regeneration
Static pages which will serve dynamic like pages

`sanity.io`

### Tech Stack
- Next.js
- TailwindCSS 3.0
- TypeScript (for strongly type checking)
- React
- Sanity CMS
- GROQ

--- 
Manually Go to `sanity.io/manage` for the dashboard </br>
Link from next.js will pre-fetch the page and make it faster </br>
`object-contain` will keep the aspect ratio of the image </br>
Anything without breakpoints like md, lg, sm will apply to mobile (mobile first design)</br>
`space-x-<number>`: for space between flex items
